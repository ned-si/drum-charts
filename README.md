# Drum Charts

This repository contains drum charts for various songs, created using
[LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/). The base for these charts is usually
transcriptions from Drumeo (though some have since been removed and are no
longer available). In other cases, the source may be random internet material or
my own transcriptions.

## About LilyPond

LilyPond is a music engraving software that generates beautiful sheet music from
text-based input files. Unlike traditional music notation software, LilyPond
uses a powerful scripting approach, allowing for detailed customization and
high-quality output.

## Structure of Drum Charts

Each drum chart in this repository is organized by song sections, making it easy
to navigate between different parts of the song (e.g., Intro, Chorus, Bridge).
The charts separate hands and feet using custom voices (stems up for hands,
stems down for feet), with clear labels for each section.

### Key Elements:
- **Section-based layout:** Drum parts are split into song sections, making it
easier to focus on individual segments during practice.
- **Custom Notation:** Weâ€™ve defined custom notation in `definitions.ly` for
unique visual clarity. This allows for an easily readable format that highlights
critical rhythmic patterns and beats.
- **Legend:** A `legend.pdf` is available to explain all custom symbols and
notation used in the charts.
- **Alternatives**: Sometimes alternatives are used for beginnings, and
sometimes for endings, but usually not for both at the same time. While it would
be cleaner to include both in a single score, having only one per chart improves
readability and understanding.

## Examples of Alternatives

In the repository, you will also find examples of alternative arrangements.
These show variations for both the beginning and the ending of certain sections,
providing different ways to interpret transitions in songs.
