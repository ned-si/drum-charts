# Drum Charts

This repository contains drum charts for various songs, created using
[LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/).

## Structure of Drum Charts

Each drum chart in this repository is organized by song sections, making it easy
to navigate between different parts of the song (e.g., Intro, Chorus, Bridge).
The charts separate hands and feet using custom voices (stems up for hands,
stems down for feet), with clear labels for each section.
The goal is to have charts focused on structure and concepts, not note-for-note
transcriptions.

### Key Elements
- **Section-based layout:** Drum parts are split into song sections, making it
easier to focus on individual segments during practice.
- **Custom Notation:** We’ve defined custom notation in `definitions.ly` for
unique visual clarity. This allows for an easily readable format that highlights
critical rhythmic patterns and beats.
- **Legend:** A `legend.pdf` is available to explain all custom symbols and
notation used in the charts.
